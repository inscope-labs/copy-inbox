# Standing Instructions for AI Studio Build Agent — copy-inbox

## 1. Mandatory Process Report on Every Task

This environment provides no way to copy, save, or download your
responses. You MUST record a report for every task you complete, saved
as an actual file in the repository (not just a chat response),
committed and pushed:

Path: agent-reports/<UTC-ISO-timestamp>-<short-task-slug>.md

Always use this single path — never app/agent-reports/ or any other
location. If a report already exists at this path for a prior task,
that is expected; each task still gets its own new timestamped file,
never an overwrite.

The report must include:
- What was asked.
- What you actually changed (files touched, with a diff or summary).
- Any commands you ran and their results.
- Any assumptions you made.
- Any errors, partial failures, or things you were unable to verify.

This folder must NOT be gitignored; it must be pushed to GitHub so it
can be read outside this environment.

## 1.1 Issue Tracking Directories (issues/pending, issues/resolved)

Any rule elsewhere in this document that requires "flagging" a gap does
so by creating a discrete issue file, not only a line in the agent
report. The report line and the issue file are both required — the
report explains what happened in this task; the issue file is the
durable, directly-checkable record that survives independently of any
single report.

**Location:** `issues/pending/` and `issues/resolved/` at repository
root. Neither may be gitignored; both must be pushed to GitHub.

**Filename:** `<file-path-with-slashes-as-underscores>__<ISSUE-TYPE>.md`
e.g. a logging gap in `app/src/main/java/.../ui/MainActivity.kt` becomes
`issues/pending/app_src_main_java_com_inscopelabs_abx_clipinbox_ui_MainActivity.kt__LOGGING-GAP.md`.
One file per (source file, issue type) pair — a file can have multiple
open issues of different types, each its own issue file.

**Issue file contents:**
- Full file path (human-readable, not just encoded in the filename).
- Issue type (e.g. `LOGGING-GAP`, `FILE-SIZE`, `COMPLIANCE-CHECK`).
- One-line reason.
- Date flagged and source agent-report filename.

**Before creating a new issue:** check whether one already exists in
`issues/pending/` for this exact (file, type) pair. If it does, do not
create a duplicate — leave the existing one in place.

**Resolving an issue:** `git mv` the file from `issues/pending/` to
`issues/resolved/`, and append a short "RESOLVED" section (date,
resolving agent-report filename, brief note on the fix). Never delete
an issue file outright — the resolved record is the audit trail.

## 2. Version Increment Rule (version.properties)

`version.properties` is exclusively AI-Studio-agent-controlled. CI workflows must NEVER write to `version.properties`.

`version.properties` uses the following keys:
- `versionCode` (integer)
- `versionName` (string, e.g. `1.0`)
- `debugCode` (zero-padded integer string, e.g. `0003`)

For every task, the AI Studio agent must assess a probability score (0-100) representing the likelihood that the task needs a new debug build.
- If the score is **greater than 75**, increment `versionCode` by 1 and `debugCode` by 1 (preserving its zero-padded width, e.g. `0003` -> `0004`).
- `versionName` stays manual-only and is not auto-incremented by the agent.
- `versionCode` from `version.properties` is the single counter shared by both debug and release builds (passed to Gradle via `-PversionCode`), while `versionName` differs per build type as implemented in the two workflows.
- The mandatory agent process report MUST explicitly state the assessed probability score and the resulting version increment action taken.

## 2.1 Release Tracking (release-code.txt)

`release-code.txt` is owned exclusively by the `build-apk-release.yml` CI workflow.
- It tracks `releaseMajor`, `releaseMinor`, and `releasePatch`.
- `release-code.txt`'s `releasePatch` is incremented and persisted by `build-apk-release.yml` itself after each successful release build — the AI Studio agent should never manually edit `releasePatch`.
- It is NOT subject to the agent-only restriction defined in Section 2.
- The `build-apk-release.yml` workflow reads these parameters to compute the release version output for builds.

## 3. Mandatory Logging Standard

Every new Activity, Fragment, feature, or discrete piece of functionality
must implement adequate logging of its own process flow — entry points,
key decision branches, and completion/failure outcomes — sufficient for
someone to reconstruct what happened after the fact from the log file
alone, without needing to reproduce the issue live. Use the existing
Logger facade (com.inscopelabs.abx.clipinbox.diagnostics.Logger — d/i/w/e)
exactly as it's already used throughout the codebase. Logger is safe to
call from any file regardless of build variant — it resolves to a real
implementation in debug builds and a true no-op in release builds
automatically, so new code never needs to guard calls to it or worry about
whether it's "allowed" to log; just call it the same way existing code
already does.

If a task requires reading, reviewing, or writing to an EXISTING file that
does not already implement adequate logging per the standard above, flag
it: create an issue file per Section 1.1 with type `LOGGING-GAP`, and
reference it in the task's mandatory agent report (per Section 1). This
applies whether or not the file was otherwise in scope for the task's
actual changes — flagging a logging gap does not require fixing it in
the same task unless the task's own scope already covers that file's
logic.

## 3.1 Logging Gap Remediation on Touch

Before starting any task, the agent MUST check `issues/pending/` for any
`LOGGING-GAP` issue naming a file this task is about to read, edit, or
create logic in.

- If a match exists, fixing that file's logging per the Section 3
  standard is added to this task's scope automatically — not deferred,
  not treated as a separate task, even if the prompt itself didn't
  mention it.
- The agent report for this task must state explicitly:
  - "PRIOR LOGGING GAPS FOUND: <issue file> — resolved / not resolved,
    why" for each match.
  - "PRIOR LOGGING GAPS FOUND: none" if no match exists.
- Resolving the gap means moving the issue file to `issues/resolved/`
  per Section 1.1, and the file now meets the Section 3 standard (entry
  points, key decision branches, completion/failure outcomes via the
  `Logger` facade).
- If a matched file cannot be fully remediated within the task's scope
  (e.g. the gap spans logic genuinely unrelated to the task), the agent
  must state why and leave the issue file in `issues/pending/` rather
  than silently ignoring it.

## 4. Single-Responsibility File Discipline

Every `.kt` file must fulfill exactly one of two roles:

- **Orchestrator** — coordinates and delegates (Activities, Fragments,
  ViewModels, Services, UseCases). Contains sequencing and wiring only;
  business logic, parsing, classification, and transformation rules must
  live in a separate Module file and be called, not implemented inline.
- **Module** — implements one cohesive unit of logic (a single class or
  tightly related small set of functions) and does not itself orchestrate
  calls across unrelated domains.

A file that both orchestrates AND implements substantial business logic
inline is a violation regardless of size.

## 4.1 Size-Triggered Compliance Tiers (applies on sight, not just on touch)

These thresholds apply the moment a file crosses them, independent of
whether the current task otherwise concerns that file — do not wait for
an unrelated task to happen to land on it.

- **Files > 180 lines:** before this task proceeds, run a mandatory
  compliance check against Section 3 (Mandatory Logging Standard) and
  Section 4 (Single-Responsibility) for that file. State the result in
  the agent report under a "COMPLIANCE CHECK (>180L): <file> — <pass /
  gaps found>" line. If gaps are found, create the corresponding issue
  file(s) per Section 1.1 (`LOGGING-GAP` and/or `COMPLIANCE-CHECK` type
  as applicable). Gaps found do not block the task itself.

- **Files > 300 lines:** the file must NOT be included in any task's
  scope — not read into, not edited, not extended — except a task
  explicitly designated a **restructuring task**.

If a non-restructuring task's scope requires touching a file already
over 300 lines, the agent must stop, not proceed, and create an issue
file of type `FILE-SIZE` per Section 1.1 if one doesn't already exist,
stating this explicitly under a "BLOCKED — FILE OVER 300L: <file>" line
in the report, rather than making the edit anyway.

Before starting any task, check `issues/pending/` for any `FILE-SIZE` or
`COMPLIANCE-CHECK` issue naming a file in this task's touch-set. A match
adds remediation to this task's scope automatically, per the same
pattern as Section 3.1.

## 4.2 Restructuring Tasks Are Repository-Wide Compliance Audits

Because restructuring means moving or removing code rather than deleting
it outright, the relocated logic carries its compliance state with it —
splitting a file does not by itself fix anything the code was already
failing at. A restructuring task must therefore:

- not add new features or change external behavior;
- split the file along Orchestrator/Module role lines until all
  resulting files are ≤ 180 lines where reasonably achievable;
- check EVERY file touched by the split — source file, each new
  destination file, and any existing file that imports/calls the code
  being moved — against the full standing AGENTS.md rule set (logging,
  security/redaction boundaries, package/domain isolation, migration
  safety, etc.), not only the rule that triggered the restructuring;
- preserve or add tests sufficient to confirm behavior didn't change as
  a side effect of the split;
- resolve the triggering `FILE-SIZE` issue (move to `issues/resolved/`
  per Section 1.1) and any other issue files that get fixed as a side
  effect of the split;
- report each touched file individually under a "RESTRUCTURING AUDIT:
  <file> — <compliant / gaps found + which rule + issue file created>"
  line, so the audit trail is per-file, not a single pass/fail for the
  whole task.
